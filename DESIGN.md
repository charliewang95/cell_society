###Introduction

* The problem our team is trying to solve by writing this program is to be able to animate any two-dimensional grid cellular automata, CA, simulation.
* The primary design goals of the project will be to make code that is easy to add new features to and work with a wide variety of different CA simulations. 
* The primary architecture of the design will have some open and some closed architecture. The open architecture will be mainly the classes dealing with different features that our simulation offers with an easy way to add a new feature as well as the code that implements the different type of neighbor rules to add more unique rules to the simulation that may not have been originally thought of.

###Overview



###User Interface

* The user interface will use JavaFx's Stage and Scene classes to create an interface for the user to enter their desired size and set of rules into. It will appear with the title of the interface at the top. Something like "Cell Society: A Cellular Automata Simulation" will work. It will also have two TextFields. One will be used for the user to enter the size they would like their simulation to be and the other will be for the user to enter the file name for the XML file that contains the rules they would like to use for their simulation. For the TextFields, the user will just have to type in their input and hit enter to submit. Also any errors with their input will be pointed out to them by text at the bottom of the screen.
* Here is a really rough sketch of what the user interface could look like:
