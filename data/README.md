**How to test using the XML files**

When running the program, the first start screen will ask you to enter a simulation.

Call the simulation in this exact format, not their AKA format:

1. FireRule 
2. SchellingRule (AKA segregation)
3. WatorRule (AKA predator-prey)
4. LifeRule (AKA game of life)

This command will call the XML files for you. 

When running the program, the start screen will ask you to enter a file name of a simulation. 

Things to keep in mind: 

- The file names are not case-sensitive
- The file names do not require the .xml extension; the program will add it on if not found.
- The file must be in the data/xml folder or chosen through the file browser. 

The ones provided are:

1. FireRule
2. FireRuleTry
3. LifeRule
4. SchellingRule
5. SugarRule
6. WatorRule

The writing of XML files within a given simulation was implemented for the following simulations:

1. FireRule
2. LifeRule
3. SchellingRule
